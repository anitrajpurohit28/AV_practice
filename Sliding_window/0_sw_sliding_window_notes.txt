1. Find what calculations are to be made
2. do the calculations and get the answer
3. Slide the window

Till we have not reached array size
    1. perform the calculation
    if window size is not reached K
        just keep performing the calculation
    else: # reached the window size
        a. GET RESILTS by use the calculation performed
        b. Decrement the 1st index from window size
        c. increment both left and right pointer
    return the result

Solution template:

Fixed window size:
------------------
i = 0
j = 0
while j < len(arr):
    #do calculations
    if current_window_size < K:  # < current_window_size = j-i+1; k = given window size
        j++
    if current_window_size == k  :# < current_window_size = j-i+1;
        # answer <- computation
        # remove i from calculations
        # slide the window; window size is maintained
    
return the answer


Variable length window size:
----------------------------
i = 0
j = 0
while j < len(arr):
    do calculations

    if condition < k:  # Given condition which will be passed as argument
        # no nothing
    elif condition == k:
        answer <- computation
    elif condition > k:
        while condition > k:
            remove item from ith index
            i++
    j++
