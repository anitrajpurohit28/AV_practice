Stack Identification:
---------------------
1. Problem is on arrays/string.
    Most of Array or string questions can be worked with arrays or heaps
    Heaps -> gives the feeling of sorting in some form, highest/lowest type
    Stack -> Could be used
2. Brute force algo could be used and the complexity would be O(n2).
    for (int i=0; i< n; i++){
        for (int j=0; j<i; j++){
            // Calculations;
        }
    }
    the j'th loop is dependent on i'th loop.
    It could be in any direction, like
    j=0; j<n; j++       // j -> 0 to n; j++
    j=0; j<i; j++       // j -> 0 to i; j++
    j=i; j>0; j--       // j -> i to 0; j--
    j=i; j>n; j++       // j -> i to n; j++
    j=n; j>i; j++       // j -> n to i; j--

    In this case; 100% stack can be used;

# Iterate:
# xxx -> Highest or Lowest
# Right to Left: if need to find next xxx element to the right
# Left to Right: if need to find next xxx element to the left
#
